1) Support SELECTION API to define crop region on the image for encode.

Particularly for resolutions that aren't a multiple of the macroblock
size, the codec will report a resolution that is a multiple of the macroblock
size (it has to have the memory to decode into), and then a different crop
region within that buffer.
The most common example is 1080P, where the buffer will be 1920x1088 with a
crop region of 1920x1080.

2) Extend the ISP support to add more of the controls.
